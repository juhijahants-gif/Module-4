# Classes and Objects in Python: Calculate the Area of a Circle

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the *area of a circle* based on the radius provided by the user. This program uses a class named cse and a method mech to perform the calculation.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. *Get user input*: Take the radius of the circle as input from the user.
2. *Define the class*: Create a class named cse.
3. *Define the method*: Inside the class, define the method mech to calculate the area of the circle using the formula:  
   Area = pi *r^2 
4. *Execute the program*: Create an object of the class and call the method with the radius value.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
import math as m
class pen:
    def stationary(self,a):
        self.a=a
    def f(self):
        print(f"Area of circle: {self.a*self.a*m.pi:.2f}")
d=int(input())
s=pen()
s.stationary(d)
s.f()
```
## Output
